Building Envelope Analysis for Cooling Optimization

This repository contains a Python based simulation framework for analyzing
the influence of building envelope material properties on cooling performance
in small data centers.

The model applies steady state heat transfer principles to evaluate how
material conductivity, thickness, and envelope configuration affect cooling
loads under defined indoor and outdoor conditions.

## Scope
- Small data centers
- Building scale thermal modeling
- Steady state conduction dominated analysis
- Civil / building systems focus

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
