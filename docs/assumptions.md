# Modeling Assumptions

1. Steady state thermal conditions are assumed.
2. Indoor air temperature is spatially uniform.
3. Heat transfer through the envelope is dominated by conduction.
4. Convective and radiative effects are lumped into effective resistances.
5. Solar gains are neglected in the baseline model.
6. Internal heat generation from IT equipment is constant.

These assumptions are appropriate for first order building thermal analysis and comparative envelope material studies.
